- 👋 Hi, I’m @ImAciidz - L4D speedrunner with interest in other source games
- 👀 I’m interested in *learning* C/C++ and reverse engineering source engine games (primarily L4D series). My current programming knowledge comes from some high school compsci classes (AP Java and also a class on JS/HTML/CSS, so not much lol).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...well...not much lmao
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...probably nothing?
- 📫 How to reach me - Discord is ImAciidz#4686, Twitch is /xImAciidz
