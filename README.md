- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ImAciidz - L4D speedrunner with some interest in Portal 2, Half-Life, and Titanfall 2.
  - I'm a member of the [L4D Community Team](https://github.com/L4D-Community-Team)
  - I've done extensive QA/testing for (and made minor contributions to) [Source Speedrun Tools](https://mikes.software/sst), a plugin for speedrunners of Source Engine games
  - Admin/supermod of the [L4D leaderboards](https://speedrun.com/left_4_dead) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com)
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in *learning* C/C++ and reverse engineering source engine games (primarily L4D series). My current programming knowledge comes from some high school compsci classes (AP Java and also a class on JS/HTML/CSS, so not much lol). I took these classes in 2017-2019, so I've since forgotten just about everything beyond fundamentals.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning...well...not much lmao (severe ADHD and a myriad of other mental health issues goes brr)
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on...~~probably nothing?~~ the L4D Speedrunning Wiki project which can be found [here](https://github.com/l4dsr/l4dsr-wiki)
- üì´ How to reach me - Discord is `aciidz` (formerly `aciidz#4686`), Twitch is [aciidzSR](https://twitch.tv/aciidzSR), YouTube is [@aciidz](https://youtube.com/@aciidz)
- Some things are mirrored on [my GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/imaciidz)

<details><summary>Click here to see a list of programming-adjacent goals/things I'd like to do in no particular order (pretty much everything listed is presently outside of my capabilities, and probably will be for a long time because my brain is tiny)</summary>

- LiveSplit
  - Make a tool that can arbitrarily delete attempts from the history and correct the attempt indexes/count afterward
  - Make a tool that can combine the attempt history of split files
  - Add autosave feature to LiveSplit itself (automatically create backups of split file every x reset/etc, to prevent loss from power outages or crashes, etc)
  - Make autosplitter & load remover for SE:NZA 1/2/Trilogy (if I get interested in running the games again)
  - Have a way to sync loadless timers over the internet (want accurate timers for non-host in L4D2 co-op, but honestly don't see this happening until SST itself does timing)
  - Add alpha(?) transparency so you don't need to key out the background color in OBS anymore (this is probably hard if I had to guess)
- Source Engine
  - Left 4 Dead 2
    - Reverse engineer infected [pathing changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5lO8qnRxyk) done by Valve during the development of The Last Stand update
    - Figure out how to bypass CEG in earlier versions of the game so that speedrunners can use game files that are more clean/official where applicable
    - idk man there's a lot of stuff lol, see the SST entry below
  - SST
    - Help add more features/fix bugs/etc. Some ideas [here](https://github.com/SirWillian/sst/issues)
  - Port L4D2 movement to other games for a laugh
- BOIII/T7x (I am aware the client is defunct, this is mostly for my own personal interest)
  - Fix joining/restarting in zombies causing black screen/softlock
  - Patch in support for >240Hz....why is this a limitation Treyarch ;_; (this is also an issue in AW, MWR, and MW2CR, so if I ever manage to do this, I'd like to fix it on all of them).
  - Fix issue with the XP progress for the current level getting reset when entering stats menu
  - Fix 25 day error (since it was apparently fixed in IW4X, this should be something I have the slightest chance of figuring out how to do?? xd)
- OBS
  - Make a script that automatically toggles my gamma filter if the game being captured is Left 4 Dead (2)
- Other
  - Probably too ambitious, but make an open source version of the program NetLimiter since it went down the toilet (NetLimiter 4 was a lifetime license and no longer available if you don't already have a license for it, 5 is a subscription model, those with a lifetime license for 4 can only use 5 for like two years or something lmao)
  - Manipulate Logitech's OnboardMemoryManager to be able to change polling rate/DPI without needing to open the actual program
  - Write something to match all unknown tracks in my full spotify play history with the custom songs in my library in conjunction with data I have from last.fm, in an attempt to create a more accurate listening history ~~to submit to fmbot someday~~
  - Make my own bot/service similar to .fmbot (submitting spotify track history to .fmbot only counts towards your scrobbles for as long as you remain subscribed to premium - as soon as you unsubscribe, those imported scrobbles go away until you subscribe again, and I'm not going to pay for .fmbot premium for the rest of my life, so...yeah)
  - Make my own website/set up a personal Gitea instance
